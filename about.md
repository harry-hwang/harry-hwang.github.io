I was an Economic student back in college and my first master degree. 

### More Information

Love cooking but not eating. Learned to play electrice piano sice I was 6 and start learning bass since I was a sophomore. Enjoy reading(at least 10 books a year) and my favorite author is Eileen Chang. I'm also a huge Harry Potter fan and that's also why I'm facinated by programming too, cause it's "Magic"!
